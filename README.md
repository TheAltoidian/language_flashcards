# Language Flashcards
This application will help you learn the 1000 most common French words. Open main.py, then press any button to start. It will show a word in French, and you have 3 seconds to guess out loud (or in your head) before it shows the English translation. 

If you got it incorrect, press the X button to move on to the next random word. If you got it correct, press the Checkmark button, and it will remove that word from the list since you no longer need to learn it. 

Close the application and reopen at any time, and when you reopen it, it will continue choosing random words, excluding the ones you've learned the last time you used it.
